# L1/ L2 Regularization

## What's L1 and L2 regularization

L2 is the sum of the sure of the weights
L1 is the sum of the absolute values.

## What's the difference between L1 and L2?

L2 has unique solutions and L1 have multiple solutions. see the following picture.

## What's the L1 and L2 loss?

L1 loss is least sum of absolute deviation
L2 loss is least sum of square of the difference tween the target value and the estimated values.
