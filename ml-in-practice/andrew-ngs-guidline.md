# Train/dev/test/distribution 

Choose a dev set and test set to reflect data you expect to get in fth future and cosindier important to do well on.

# Size of the dev and test sets

Traditionally, train/test: 70%, 30%; or train/dev/test:60%, 20%, 20%

Currently, train/dev/test: 99%, 1%, 1% for deep learning algorithm.

Size of test set: set your test set to be going enough to give high confidence in the overall performance of your system.


# When to change dev/test sets and metrics?

If doing well on your metric + dev/test set don't correspond to doing well on your application, change your metric and/or dev/test set.
