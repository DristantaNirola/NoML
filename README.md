# NoML--No Machine Learning

This is a  notebook for me to prepare ML interview. The basic idea is to collect all the ML knowledge \(or questions\) that might have been asked or will be asked for an ML engineer interview. You might think that we can read a ML book, why do we need to create this notebook? Because sometimes, when we read a book, we don't know what kind of question will be asked.

So the beauty of this book is to collect questions or asked questions 

## Structure

For each topic, like overfitting, we simply ask questions, and each answer should be completed within_**140 words**_. Yes, I do believe that Twitter gives us a golden rule, anything can be explained within 140 words. Then if necessary, give an explanation. Please note,** you can asked any questions.  But the answer you provided should always come with a link\(give credits to the original author\).**

For example,

```markdown
Q: What's overfitting?

A: Overfitting refers to a model that models the training data too well.
   Overfitting happens when a model learns the detail and noise in 
   the training data to the extent that it negatively impacts the 
   performance of the model on new data.

E: You can give some explanations here.
